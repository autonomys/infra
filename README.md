# Subspace Infrastructure.

This project declares the infrastructure currently used by Subspace Network.

We use **Terraform** and **DigitalOcean**. Any **project**, **droplet**, **volume**, **attachment** must be defined in this repository to be reviewed and deployed using IAC.

Terraform projects folder structure:

```
└──  resources
    └── aries-dev/
    └── aries-test-a/
    └── aries-test-b/
    └── polkadot-archive/
    └── status-page/
    └── telemetry/
    └── common.tf 
```

- `common.tf` is located on the resources folder, it contains all the definitions to be used for each project. 
- To re use common definitions a `symlink` is created using `/resources/common.tf` as the source.
- If you need to **create a new project**:
    - go to the **resources** folder, 
    - create a **new folder-project** 
    - link common definitions running `ln -s ../common.tf common.tf`. 
- Then you are ready to follow instructions to **init** terraform, **add resources**, **plan** the resource deployment and **apply** the resource deployments in **DigitalOcean**

_To apply any updates or new definitions_ you must always work in a separate branch and create a _Pull Request to the main branch_. 


## Pre requisites.

Install Terraform cli:

- https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli

## Getting started.

Start by defining your personal DigitalOcean access token as an env variable, so you won’t have to set your token each time you run Terraform.
You can find your API token in your [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens) account.

```
export DO_TOKEN=9999999999999999aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

Go to **resources/PROJECT_NAME** directory and run the following commands to init terraform:

```
terraform init
```

You are ready to run the **plan** and **apply** command with this.

## Deploy resources.

In the **resources/PROJECT_NAME** directory, run the following commands:


1. Run the **plan** command with the variable values passed in to see Terraform's steps to deploy your project resources.

```SH
terraform plan -var "do_token=${DO_TOKEN}" -out current-plan.tfplan
# DO NOT FORGET TO EXPORT DO_TOKEN before running this command. 
```

2. Run the **apply** command with the generated **current-plan.tfplan**.

```SH
terraform apply "current-plan.tfplan"
```

Terraform will apply changes and generate/update the **.tfstate** file.
Be aware that state files can contain sensitive information. Do not expose it to the public repository.


Note: When creating a new workspace for a project, ensure to change plan execution from remote to local from the workspace->settings->Execution Mode.
Choose local so only the state is store and tracked and execution can be done from the local instead of terraform cloud.
