# Subspace DNS

This holds DNS records that are not tied to the resources maintained in the repository.

## How to add a new DNS record?
A new DNS record can be added to records.tf. Here is an example

```
resource "cloudflare_record" "name_of_the_resource" {
  name    = "name_of_the_resource"
  proxied = true/false
  ttl     = 1
  type    = "CNAME"
  value   = "subspace.github.io"
  zone_id = data.cloudflare_zone.cloudflare_zone.id #do not change this
}
```

1. Copy the above example to records.tf
